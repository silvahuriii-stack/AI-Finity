# Digital Twin Accounting — Streamlit prototype

Simple Streamlit prototype that:
- Connects to Sanity via GROQ (HTTP)
- Displays time series cashflow, lightweight forecast
- Provides a quick "Digital Twin" simulator (price/volume/cost multipliers)
- Allows running custom GROQ queries (for advanced users)

## Setup (local)
1. Clone repo
2. Create virtualenv & install:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Export env vars (optional if using public dataset):
   export SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   export SANITY_DATASET=production
   export SANITY_TOKEN=your_write_or_read_token
4. Run:
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

## Deploy to Streamlit Cloud / Railway / Render
- Push to GitHub.
- On deployment platform, set the environment variables (SANITY_PROJECT_ID, SANITY_DATASET, SANITY_TOKEN) as Secrets.
- Set the start command to: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

## Notes
- This is a prototype. Untuk production: tambahkan pagination, proper error handling, rate limit handling, auth, dan validasi query.
